# NFC Deck
This is a complex iteration of the EspDeck in order to allow control of multi room audio systems (or anything else you want to use it for). There are two top panel iterations, one for 9 mechanical key switches, and one for 8 key switches and one rotary encoder.

# Components:
  * ESP8266 / NodeMCU
  * 8  x Mechanical Key Switches
  * 1  x Rotary Encoder
  * 1  x NFC Card Reader
  * 10 x WS2812 LEDs
  * 1  x Piezo Buzzer
  * 4 x [Rubber Feet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XPCLN23)
